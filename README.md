# 📘 Cohort State Transition Model (Excel LAMBDA)

This repository contains an Excel workbook that includes a **LAMBDA
formula** capable of calculating the results of a **cohort state
transition model**-- commonly used in **cost-effectiveness
analysis**---in a *single formula call*.

The approach demonstrates how complex health economic modeling can be
implemented directly within Excel using built-in LAMBDA functions,
without the need for Visual Basic for Applications (VBA).

This work was presented as **Poster SA60** at **ISPOR EU 2025**.
